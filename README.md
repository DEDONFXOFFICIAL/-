## 🛠️ How This Site Was Built

I didn’t learn to code in the traditional way. Instead, I used the tools available to me — particularly **AI** — to guide me through deploying this website.

This site was built with:
- Curiosity
- Consistency
- A willingness to learn
- AI tools for frontend development

> I proudly say: **AI helped me build it, but the vision, content, and direction are fully mine.**

This is more than just a site — it’s a personal snapshot of effort, energy, and evolution.
